## Introduction

Scene text spotting involves detecting and recognizing text in complex, real-world images. This repository provides an end-to-end solution combining detection and recognition modules to handle various challenges in scene text, such as occlusion, distortions, and diverse scripts.

## Features

- End-to-end text spotting framework.
- Support for multi-language recognition.
- Integration of modern machine learning and deep learning models.
- Customizable for specific datasets and tasks.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AmitC04/SCENE-TEXT-SPOTTING-TEXT-RECOGNITION.git

2. Navigate to the project directory: cd SCENE-TEXT-SPOTTING-TEXT-RECOGNITION

3.Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1.Run the following command to process an image:
python main.py --image <path_to_image> --output <path_to_output>

2.For training, use:
python train.py --config <path_to_config>

3.Refer to the scripts for additional options and configurations.

## Datasets

This project supports the following datasets:ICDAR 2015
                                             TotalText
(Custom datasets can be configured as per the data_loader.py specifications.)
